- There could be different ways in ensuring that the problem of borrowing books when no copies are available. One way would be to do it in the schema
of your database itself. Another way, and this would be my way would be to handle it in the frontend. Make functions that check these conditions beforehand
so that before it even gets to the database, the information would have already been checked and filtered out. The option where checking the conditions in
database sounds a bit too troublesome as well as I think might cause some unwanted problems rather compared to just filtering what comes in the database first
and making sure that they all align with the conditions so that the database is not too complicated.
