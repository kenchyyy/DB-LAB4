What challenges might arise when scaling this database to handle millions of users and books? Suggest one solution for each challenge.

- Performance might degrade and slow down. This can happen when too many users and queries are being done to the database. I believe this can be solved
by optimizing the database so that it can handle that amount of requests and queries. One solution the internet suggests is by indexing frequently used 
columns to help the database find them much faster when querying.

- Another problem that might arise is connection overloading. Too much users trying to connect to the database will lead to an overload in connecting to
the databse. A quick search on the internet says that a solution to this problem would be to implement connection pooling and use tools like PgBouncer.

- Storage problems will also surely be a problem once the user base grows and data keeps coming in. Managing the storage that keeps growing and growing as 
the number of users and loans and books grow will be a task. A solution to this would be to implement data archiving where older data gets deleted or stored
somewhere else like a different table or a different more dedicated database for older data.
